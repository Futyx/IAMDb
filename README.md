# 🎬 IAMDb: Advanced Movie Management & Search System (3-Route SPA)

A sophisticated, fully reactive Single-Page Application (SPA) developed using **Vue 3** and **Vue Router**. This project connects to an external API to retrieve top movie data and utilizes a clear **three-route structure** to separate core functionalities, demonstrating strong command of dynamic routing and state management.

## ✨ Features & Technical Focus

This project is engineered to highlight your expertise in complex data handling, application state, and dynamic components:

* **Three-Route Architecture:** Uses **Vue Router** to manage three primary views (`/`, `/movies`, `/movie/:id`), showcasing best practices for application navigation.
* **Advanced Global Search:** Implements a powerful, unified search input that filters the movie list across **multiple attributes simultaneously** (Title, Release Date, Country, Genres, etc.) directly on the `/movies` route.
* **Inline Favorites Management (State Persistence):** Users can mark movies as favorites directly on the list. The status is **persisted** (likely via Local Storage) without needing a dedicated separate page.
* **Dynamic Detail View:** Features dynamic routing (`/movie/:id`) to display complete and detailed information for a single selected film on a dedicated page.
* **Technology:** Vue 3, Vue Router, JavaScript (ES6+), External API Integration.
